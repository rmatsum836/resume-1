\begin{cvletter}

I am an enthusiastic researcher and am writing to express my interest in
    joining the Field Phenotyping team at BASF.  
    I am particularly excited about the work of developing software solutions
    and automated workflows to enable sustainable agriculture.

    I believe my background would make me a great fit with your team.  During my
    academic training in molecular modeling, I developed a strong foundation in
    Python and data analysis, regularly developing software to implement
    statistical methods for understanding simulation data.  
    For instance, I developed an automated workflow to run simulations for over 
    400 chemical systems, conduct various analysis techniques, and compile the data into CSV format.  
    As part of this project, I leveraged Python, data visualization, and Pandas.  
    The projects I worked on were highly collaborative and I had the opportunity
    to solve problems in various cross-disciplinary teams.
    My work in as a graduate student resulted in 10 peer-reviewed journal articles and 2
    conference presentations.

    I am also dedicated to expanding my technical skillset and learning new approaches to
    efficiently solve problems.  In my personal time, I developed an image
    analysis workflow to predict phase separation of fluid mixtures.
    Additionally, I developed a machine learning model to predict baseball
    pitch types from structured data sets.  My understanding is that the above
    skills would be transferable to perform the tasks required for a Scientific
    Programmer at BASF.

    Computational approaches have shown immense promise for enabling discoveries
    in scientific research.  It would be a privilege to support the
    Field Phenotyping team efforts as a Scientific Programmer.

    I appreciate your time and consideration.
