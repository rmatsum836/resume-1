\begin{cvletter}

I am an enthusiastic researcher writing to express my interest in
    joining the Data Science Institute at Middle Tennessee State University.
    I am particularly excited about the opportunity to work on various projects
    and gain experience in data science.

    I believe my background would make me a great fit within the institute.  During my
    academic training in molecular modeling, I developed a strong foundation in
    Python and data analysis, regularly developing software to implement
    statistical methods for understanding simulation data.  
    For instance, I developed an automated workflow on a computer cluster to run simulations for over 
    400 chemical systems, conduct various analysis techniques, and compile the data into CSV format.  
    I have also worked on several open-source Python
    projects through the use of GitHub and contributing unit-testing, bug fixes,
    and new features.

    In regards to my technical expertise in data science, I have completed
     projects leveraging the Python data science ecosystem.  I developed
    a machine learning classification model with scikit-learn, Jupyter, and
    pandas to predict baseball pitch types using structured data.  

    My biggest strength, however, is in effective collaboration within diverse
    teams.  As an example, I led a project with 3 graduate students and 1
    postdoctoral researcher in which we demonstrated how reproducible simulation workflows could be
    developed with open-source software.  My participiation in collaborative
    research resulted in 10 peer-reviewed journal articles and 2 conference presentations.
    My understanding is that the above skills would be
    transferable with the tasks performed as a Data Scientist.

    During graduate school, I realized I wanted to become a data scientist as the role requires strong skills in math, programming, and communication to be successful.
    It would be a privilege to support the Data Science Institute efforts as a
    Data Scientist (Level I) at Middle Tennessee State University.

    I appreciate your time and consideration.
