\begin{cvletter}

I am an enthusiastic researcher and am writing to express my interest in
    joining the Digital Farming Weater team at BASF.  
    I am particularly excited about the work of developing data-driven solutions
    to improve agriculture.

    I believe my background would make me a great fit with your team.  During my
    academic training in molecular modeling, I developed a strong foundation in
    Python and statistical modeling.
    For example, I have applied time-series methods and monte carlo simulation
    techniques to study electrolytes for energy-storage applications.
    I have extensive experience in developing software with best practices in
    mind.
    As an example, I was a developer for an open-source Python project designed
    to enable reproducible simulation workflows.  From this, I have experience
    developing unit testing suites, setting up continuous integration pipelines,
    and writing Docker images.
    I am comfortable working on multiple projects at once and delivering results
    in a timely manner.
    My work as a graduate student resulted in 10 peer-reviewed journal articles and 2
    conference presentations.

    In regards to my technical expertise in data science, I have completed
    several projects leveraging the Python data science ecosystem.  I developed
    a machine learning classification model with scikit-learn, Jupyter, and
    pandas to predict baseball pitch types with structured data.  I am also
    familiar with big data technologies, namely, Amazon S3 and Apache Spark.
    My understanding is that the above skills would be transferable to perform
    the tasks required for a Data Scientist at BASF.


    Data-driven approaches have shown immense promise for enabling discoveries
    in scientific research.  It would be a privilege to support the
    Digital Farming Weather team efforts as a Data Scientist.

    I appreciate your time and consideration.
