\begin{cvletter}

I am an enthusiastic researcher writing to express my interest in
    joining the Bioresource Science and Engineering Group (BSE) within the Environmental Sciences Division at Oak Ridge National Laboratory.  
    I am particularly excited about the work of using data analysis and programming to help
    better understand the availability and environmental impacts of biomass
    resources.

    I believe my background would make me a great fit with your group.  During my
    academic training in molecular modeling, I developed a strong foundation in
    Python and data analysis, regularly developing software to implement
    statistical methods for understanding simulation data.  
    For instance, I developed an automated workflow on a computer cluster to run simulations for over 
    400 chemical systems, conduct various analysis techniques, and compile the data into CSV format.  
    I have also worked on several open-source Python
    projects through the use of GitHub, contributing unit-testing, bug fixes,
    and new features.
    My work in these areas resulted in 10 peer-reviewed journal articles and 2
    conference presentations.

    In regards to my technical expertise in data science, I have completed
    several projects leveraging the Python data science ecosystem.  I developed
    a machine learning classification model with scikit-learn, Jupyter, and
    pandas to predict baseball pitch types using structured data.  

    Additionally, I am dedicated to expanding my technical skill set and learning new approaches to
    efficiently solve problems.  
    I recently completed on online course on Apache Spark to develop a greater understanding of large-scale data processing.
    My understanding is that the above skills would be
    transferable with the tasks performed in the BSE.

    Data-driven approaches have shown immense promise for enabling discoveries
    in scientific research.  It would be a privilege to support the
    BSE efforts as a Data Scientist/ Programmer.

    I appreciate your time and consideration.
